# LunaverseCore

**LunaverseCore** is a lightweight RPG plugin API for Minecraft, built to support custom content such as items, stats, and more. Originally developed as the foundation for a personal RPG project, it has since evolved into a flexible base for modular, content-driven Minecraft gameplay.

> Designed with extensibility and maintainability in mind, LunaverseCore provides an API-first approach to plugin development for RPG mechanics.
